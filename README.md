# the placeholder blog

This simple react blog is built with data from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It was built in ~5 hours.

### Demo

To view the live blog you have your choice of [Now](https://the-placeholder-blog-kuaee5imz.now.sh/) or [Netlify](https://mystifying-ptolemy-e2b4ca.netlify.com/). (I was playing with a couple different deployment methods for fun.)
